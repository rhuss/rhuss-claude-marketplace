# Threat Model Assessment Plugin - Marketing Abstract

**Automate Security Assessments with AI-Powered Code Analysis**

The Threat Model Assessment plugin transforms how security teams conduct threat modeling by leveraging Claude Code's AI capabilities to automatically analyze codebases against security requirements. Whether you're working with OWASP ASVS, CIS Controls, NIST frameworks, GDPR compliance, or internal security policies, this plugin systematically examines your code, identifies implementation gaps, and generates comprehensive documentation—all in a fraction of the time manual assessments require.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any threat modeling methodology (STRIDE, PASTA, OWASP, custom frameworks)
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Intelligent code exploration identifies security controls, data flows, and vulnerabilities with file-level precision
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Iterative assessment of multiple requirements in a single session with real-time progress tracking
- **Automated Documentation**: Generates detailed assessment reports with code references, gap analysis, and remediation recommendations
- **JIRA Integration**: Auto-creates properly formatted tickets with traceability back to source requirements
- **Deployment Aware**: Distinguishes between self-hosted and SaaS deployment models to focus on relevant controls

Perfect for security architects, DevSecOps teams, compliance officers, and anyone conducting security assessments or preparing for audits.
